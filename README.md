This is my first project on the updated The Odin Project. It is a recipe website that will have an index page with links to recipes.
It will use knowledge of HTML only. Headings and links and paragraph tags. Use of relative links.
This project also uses knowledge of inserting images into the webpage. 
I need to figure out the best practice of when to commit and push to git/github.
